# Digital Lumens Terminal

DLTerm is a terminal application, which can be used to query configuration and status from Digital Lumens fixtures and controllers. DLTerm is similar to CoolTerm or the Fixture Command Terminal dialog in Commissioner, but has the following additional features.

1. Provides helper commands like **get FirmwareVersion** or **get log**, which abstract our internal fixture protocol.
1. Translates fixture responses into human readable form like version **2.1.11 (7/21/15)** instead of **02010B0F0715**.
1. Works with PMU commands, Lightbar commands, Powerboard commands, and Battery Backup commands.
1. Provides command completion so you don't have to type full commands or remember exact syntax.
1. Provides a command history for repeating commands already entered.
1. Results are color coded for easy reading.
1. Works with Telegesis (wireless) and FTDI (wired) adapters.
