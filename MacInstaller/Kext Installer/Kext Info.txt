IMPORTANT:
----------

1. This .kext must be chown'd as system/wheel after installation:

sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/NAME.kext
sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/NAME.kext

2. Also, to tell the OS that there's a new extension, you need to:

sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions

3. The info for the "silent USB install" kext came from this Apple Technote:
